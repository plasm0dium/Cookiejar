Cookiejar is a fun Javascript coding challenge from Zeeto, a company from San Diego. The project was focus on Ajax call from third party API, local Javascript cookie that store information and share across different DOM.  Thanks to this project! I've learn so much more about browser cookie.

Note: Chrome does not support local file cookie.  If you want to test this project, you have to use IE, Safari or Firefox etc.
